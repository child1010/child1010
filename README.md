# 👋 Hello there! I'm **vt**.
## 💻 About Me
I am a hobbyist programmer who enjoys tinkering with code and building interesting projects. I have experience working with Rust, C/C++, Python, and Lua. Currently, my main project is a Discord bot called Hydrogen, which I'm building to help server owners manage their communities.

## 🤖 My Current Project
Hydrogen is a feature-rich Discord bot written in rust that allows server owners to customize commands, automate role management, and much more. I'm constantly working to improve and expand its functionality.

## 🖥️ My Editor and Configuration
I use Neovim as my text editor, and my current configuration is based on the popular Astronvim setup. It's designed to be both powerful and user-friendly, with built-in support for a wide range of programming languages through Mason.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning
I'm always eager to learn new things, and right now I'm focusing on frontend design. I'm also interested in TypeScript and Deno, two technologies that are becoming increasingly popular in the web development world.

## 📫 How to Reach Me
If you have any questions or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out to me on GitHub. I'm always happy to chat with other developers and learn from their experiences. You can also contact me on discord through vt#4339.

Thanks for stopping by my profile!
